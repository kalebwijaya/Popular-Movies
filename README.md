# Popular-Movies

To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org.

If you donâ€™t have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.

In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.

In order to request popular movies you will want to request data from the /movie/popular and /movie/top_rated endpoints (documentation). An API Key is required.

Once you obtain your key, you append it on the inside JsonHolder.java for the API_KEY.
JsonHolder.class can be found on app/src/main/java/api
